
## Basic First Flight

#### Briefing

> *The <u>goal</u> of this flight is to get familiarized with P3D and flying a VFR flight. We will perform a take-off, get used to the controls and take in the views. Then we'll return to the airport.  
> <u>Standard Safety and Emergency Procedures</u> apply.    
<u>WX</u>: The weather is fine so there are no restrictions today. It is **CAVOK** as they say: Ceiling and Visibilty OK or '*Clear Skies*' in P3D terms.*   

1. <u>TYPE</u>: We will be making a <b><i>VFR</i></b> (Visual Flight Rules) flight.
2. <u>AC ID / PIC</u>: You will be <b><i>PIC</i></b> (Pilot in Command) in a <b><i>Mooney Bravo</i></b> or <b><i>Mooney Bravo Retro</i></b>.   
<small>You'll learn why later.</small>   
3. <u>DEP</u>: Departure airport is Soesterberg Airbase (ICAO: **EHSB**).   
<small>The NL2000 v5 scenery freeware is preferred, but not necessary.</small>   
4. <u>ROUTE</u>: It will be a *local* flight, so the
5. <u>DEST</u>: Destination is also **EHSB**. 
6. <u>ALTITUDE(s)</u>: Flight altitude will be between 500 and 2000 feet.
7. <u>ETD</u> (Estimated Time of Departure): Departure time will be around noon (12:00h LT)   
<small>(in aviation we actually use **UTC** *most of the time*)</small>      
8. <u>ETE</u> (Est'd Time Enroute): The flight will be 00:20' long appx.   
  

#### Weather

###### ATIS [*(Automatic Terminal Information Service)*](ATIS.md)   
To get information on the current weather we might be able to get a pre-flight briefing from the airfield MET-Office, or if there is no MET-Office available we can listen to the ATIS message; broadcast on specific frequencies. Before we contact the tower we want to have all required information available, so Tower (TWR) won't have to repeat all this over an important radio channel.    


#### Pre-flight
Before stepping on board and starting the engine for take-off we want to perform a *walkaround* to check several (safety) aspects of the aircraft. For the purpose of this P3D Handbook we will skip this part. More information can be found here though: [Preflight Inspection](https://www.flightliteracy.com/preflight-assessment-of-the-aircraft-visual-preflight-assessment/)
